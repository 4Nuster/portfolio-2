VidDom is a system that aims to aid vehicle owners to easily contact mechanics and request oil change for their vehicle, change parts, and more.

The VidDom system comprises an API, two mobile apps (one for clients and one for mechanics), a website (to showcase the apps), and an administrator dashboard.

My work:
- Administrator Dashboard: I have worked on the frontend side of the "Schedules" page where the administrator can manage schedules (view, create, update, delete) and view the mechanics registered to each of the schedules, the schedules' region and status...

- Mobile App: I have worked on the vehicle insertion page, where the user can type their license plate code, and an API in the backend loads their vehicle's information

- Website: I have designed the UI/UX of the website, and I have collaborated with a developer in the realization of the website
